# Privacy Policy for Thumper

**Last updated: 2026-02-22**

## The short version

Thumper is entirely offline. It makes zero network connections. Your data never leaves your phone.

## Permissions and why

Thumper requests the following Android permissions:

- **Bluetooth Scan / Connect** - To find and connect to your BLE heart rate monitor. The Bluetooth data (heart rate readings) is only used to display your heart rate during a workout and store it locally on your device.
- **Fine Location** - Required by Android to perform BLE scanning. Thumper does not read, store, or transmit your location.
- **Microphone** - To detect jump rope impacts via audio amplitude. The audio is analyzed in real time for jump detection and is never recorded, stored, or transmitted.

## Data storage

All workout data (duration, heart rate readings, jump counts) is stored locally on your device in a Room database. You can export your workouts as TCX files to your Downloads folder. These files stay on your device unless you choose to share them yourself.

## Network access

Thumper does not request the INTERNET permission. It cannot make network connections. There are no analytics, no tracking, no ads, no telemetry, no crash reporting, no remote servers. Nothing phones home.

## Third parties

There are none. Thumper uses no third-party SDKs, services, or libraries that collect data.
